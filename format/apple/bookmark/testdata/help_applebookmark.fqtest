$ fq -h apple_bookmark
apple_bookmark: Apple BookmarkData decoder

Decode examples
===============

  # Decode file as apple_bookmark
  $ fq -d apple_bookmark . file
  # Decode value as apple_bookmark
  ... | apple_bookmark

Apple's bookmarkData format is used to encode information that can be resolved into a URL object for a file even if the user moves or
renames it. Can also contain security scoping information for App Sandbox support.

These bookmarkData blobs are often found endcoded in data fields of Binary Property Lists. Notable examples include:

- com.apple.finder.plist - contains an FXRecentFolders value, which is an array of ten objects, each of which consists of a name and
file-bookmark field, which is a bookmarkData object for each recently accessed folder location.
- com.apple.LSSharedFileList.RecentApplications.sfl2 - sfl2 files are actually plist files of the NSKeyedArchiver format. They can be
parsed the same as plist files, but they have a more complicated tree-like structure than would typically be found, which can make
locating and retrieving specific values difficult, even once it has been converted to a JSON representation. For more information
about these types of files, see Sarah Edwards' excellent research on the subject (link in references).

fq's grep_by function can be used to recursively descend through the decoded tree, probing for and selecting any bookmark blobs, then
converting them to readable JSON with torepr:

  fq 'grep_by(.type=="data" and .value[0:4] == "book") | .value | apple_bookmark |
  torepr' <sfl2 file>
