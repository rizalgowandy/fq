$ fq -h avro_ocf
avro_ocf: Avro object container file decoder

Decode examples
===============

  # Decode file as avro_ocf
  $ fq -d avro_ocf . file
  # Decode value as avro_ocf
  ... | avro_ocf

Supports reading Avro Object Container Format (OCF) files based on the 1.11.0 specification.

Capable of handling null, deflate, and snappy codecs for data compression.

Limitations:

- Schema does not support self-referential types, only built-in types.
- Decimal logical types are not supported for decoding, will just be treated as their primitive type
